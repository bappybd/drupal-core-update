<h3>Shell script that is capable to Drupal core upgrade only.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install drush from https://github.com/drush-ops/drush.</li>
<li>Copy shell file to drupal document root</li>
<li>Open GIT bash</li>
<li>$ cd PATH/TO/DRUPAL-DOCUMENT-ROOT/</li>
<li>$ auto-drupal-core-upgrade-only.sh -u YOUR-DRUPAL-VERSION</li>
<li>Example for Drupal 6 $auto-drupal-core-upgrade-only.sh -u 6.34</li>
